# Fraud-Transaction-Detection

Detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning (ML) is a common and essential task for financial institutions, e-commerce companies, and various other businesses. ML models can help identify unusual patterns and behaviors that may indicate fraud. 

Feature engineering is a crucial step, where relevant attributes are created or selected to aid the model in distinguishing between genuine and fraudulent transactions. These features could include transaction amount, time of day, location, and more, depending on the specific context.
